        Sometimes I have moments of inspiration, in coding, in thoughts, really
        all over. Here I've decided to keep a record of some of the more
        profound thoughts and moments I've had in my life. Although this website
        is my portfolio website, it is also about me, and I think it should
        reflect the way I think, and people can see how I think if they are
        interested in it.
