# Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my portfolio website. It is a React/Typescript project using React Router DOM and EmailJS.

Users enter into [jacobhewitson.com](http://jacobhewitson.com)'s home page and from there they can choose the navbar to be redirected to:

- [Projects](http://jacobhewitson.com/#/projects)
- [Other Services](http://jacobhewitson.com/#/other-services)
- [Contact](http://jacobhewitson.com/#/contact)

If they click on my photo on the home page they will be redirected to an [About Me](http://jacobhewitson.com/#/about) page.

## Projects
The Projects page uses a modal component from Material-UI
